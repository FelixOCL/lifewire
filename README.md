# lifewire
This is a Facebook clone i love to say, which is rather a personnal notes place so I could remember stuff from long time ago, like some reciepes.
I made that project to track some of my discoveries on the internet or stuff I could save in image format. So basically the primary example I could have found a litle receipe as a postcard and have it digitalized and then upload it to the lifewire site.

Actually we can post comments like sites and have a link created to just click on it.

TO CHECK
I used to be able to upload some pictures. I made it possible to upload png, jpg, pdf... but it's been a while and now it just stopped working.

Maybe I could use for a little help on that part.

I recently programmed that the page asks for username on first load and remember username so you don't have to enter it every time. Have made it in localStorage but happily  someday I leave it in a cookie to remember it for next visit.

Later on I would like to insert a Captcha to protect from robots and stuff.

I'm calculating it is around version 0.5. 

Next version would possibly have a page as personal profile so maybe like ./lifewire/FelixOCL/ so it's actually MY personnal notes to remember.

Hope you have fun

Obviously, i did remove password and username so you could fit it on your own setup.
